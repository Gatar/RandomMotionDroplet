# RandomMotionDroplet
Simulation of droplet driven motion by random movements on surface pattern by strips with increasing width, made by two different material types. Motion is driven in two different ways:

* random motions of half of whole droplet (ex. oscilation of surface)
* random motion of each single vertex (ex. Brownian motions, Thermal motions)
